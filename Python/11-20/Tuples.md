## Tuple

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp), and [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp), all with different qualities and usage.

A tuple is a collection which is *ordered* and **unchangeable**.

Tuples are written with round brackets.

### Ordered

When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

---

### Unchangeable

Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

### Allow Duplicates

Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```
