# Machine Learning
Large datasets available prior to formulation of scientific hypotheses/theories
Very different from hypothesis-driven research.
## (Supervised) Feature Selection
**One response**: *Y*
> e.g. disease progression status

**Thousands of variables**: *X*
> e.g. Biomarkers, genetics, speech etc.



Actual set of relevant features
$S = {X_1, X_4, X_6, X_p}$
Predicted set of relevant features
$S = {X_1, X_4, X_6, X_p, X_2}$

$X_2$ is false positive feature, but how do we avoid having this feature:
### Random Forests:






### Weights and Biases
A single experiment is a "run"

Three principles of an ideal ML workflow
*quikly iritterate*
*reproduce* 
*collabaration*
