# The Golem of Prague
The golem of Prague is the most famous story of the golem, and animated clay figure inscribed with *emet*, truth in Hebrew, on its brow. Animated by truth, but lacking free will, the golem always does exactly what is told. The golem of Prague got the wrong orders, and by mistake wrecked Prague. 

## Statistical golems
Scientists make golems too. These golems are scientific models following computational rules.
There are multiple types of model-golems with great logic and power, but *without wisdom*,  that is the **model doesn't know when something is wrong**. It just does as it's told!
All the classical statistical test are fragile, as they often break when introduced to novel data/situations. The classical tools are not diverse enough to handle many common research questions.

## Statistical rethinking:
When choosing a test, rather than **utilizing Bayesian statistics** one may feel *anxious* of **choosing the right test**.  When using Bayesian statistics the anxiety is focused on doing it wrong.
But that anxiety forces you to understand the computational nuts and bolts of the golem (model).  If you don't understand how the golem works, you can't interpret the output of the golem.

1) **Hypotheses are not models**.
	   The relations among hypotheses and different kinds of models are complex. 
	   Many models correspond to the same hypothesis, and many hypotheses correspond to a single model. *This makes strict falsification impossible.*
2) **Measurements matters**.
	   Even when we **think the data falsify a model**, *another observer* will *debate* out **methods and measurement**. They don't trust the data. Sometimes they are right.

For both these reasons, **deductive falsification never works**. *The Scientific Method* cannot be reduced to a *statistical procedure*. But **keep the complex world** of priors, methods and other studies **in mind**.
