# Tools of golem engineering
If *attempting to mimic falsification* is **not** a generally **useful** **approach** to *statistical method*, the we **instead** are to *model data*.

**Models can be made into testing procedures**
-all statistical tests are also models- 
but they can also be used to design, forecast, and argue.

## How to draw an owl = How to make a model
![[How_to_draw_an_owl.png]]
But **we will break down** *how* to *draw the owl* / *create the golem* / *create a model*:
![[How_to_draw_the_bayesian_owl.png]]
### Why you draw the Bayesian Owl
**Three reasons**:
1) Understand what you are doing (become flexible)
2) Document your work (reduce error)
3) Respectable scientific workflow 
	3.1) **Theoretical estimand** 
		What are you trying to do in the first place?
	3.2) [[Scientific model |Scientific (causal) model(s)]]
		The **theoretical estimand** will be *defined in the context* of the **scientific models**.
	3.3) **Use 3.1 & 3.2 to build [[Statistical models]]**
		We use the **scientific model** and **theoretical guess** to *create* a **statistical model.**
	3.4)  **Simulation**
		**Simulate** the **scientific model** *to validate* that the *statistical model* results in **theory estimate**.
		We also do this to be sure that the computational models  
	3.5) **Analyse real data**

***Defining attributes of Bayesian modelling:***
The Bayesian approach is **permissive and flexible**
Express **uncertainty** at *all levels*
Direct **solutions** for *measurement error, missing data, etc.*
**Focus** on *scientific modelling* (only posterior distribution as estimate)
