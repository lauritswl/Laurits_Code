# Science BEFORE Statistics
For **[[Statistical models]]** to produce scientific insight, they require additional **scientific (casual) models**.  **The reasons** for a *statistical analysis are not found* in the data **themselves**, but rather *in the **causes** of the data*.
The ***causes*** of the the data cannot be extracted from the data alone. ***No causes in; no causes out***.

Even when the goal is descriptive, we need causal models.
You need causal information about how the sample differs from the population.
