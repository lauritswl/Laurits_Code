# Loops in python
A loop is something that happens over and over and over again...
## For Loop:
A `for loop` is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

With the `for loop` we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
``` python
fruits = ["Apple", "Peach", "Pear"]
for i in fruits:
  print(i)

#prints:
#Apple
#Peach
#Pear
```
### For loops and range() function
```python
for number in range(a,b):
	print(number)
	#prints: a, a+1,a+2,...,b 
```
