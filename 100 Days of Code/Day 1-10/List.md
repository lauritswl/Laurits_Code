# Lists
A list is a [[data structure]].
The list begins with an open square bracket `[`and seperates items with commas. The list ends with a closed square bracket `]`.

The list is a structure that saves data in a arranged manner.
**Syntax:**
``` python
list = [item1, item2, ..., item_n]
```

An [[Errors#Index Error|Index Error]] can appear when working with lists.

## Nested Lists
``` python
fruits = ["Apple", "Pear", "Orange"]
vegetables = ["Carrot", "Potato", "Celery"]
food ["fruits","vegetables"]
print(food)
#####
# [[["Apple", "Pear", "Orange"]["Carrot", "Potato", "Celery"]]



```
